# HDS Capstone
## Blood Vessel Prediction on the DRIVE dataset

My final capstone project for the M.S. in Health Data Science program at Saint Louis University. Here I develop a model to identify the blood vessels in retinal images. The data is the DRIVE (https://drive.grand-challenge.org/) dataset. 

The goal is to explore the dataset, experiment with different neural network architectures, and utilize transfer learning and fine tuning, to develop a model that can accuractely segment the blood vessels within retinal images.
