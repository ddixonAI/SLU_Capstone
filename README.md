# HDS Capstone
## Blood Vessel Prediction on the DRIVE dataset

My final capstone project for the M.S. in Health Data Science program at Saint Louis University. Here I implement two models to identify the blood vessels in retinal images: U-Net and the Fully Convolutional Transformer (FCT).

U-Net: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1.pdf)
FCT: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00566.pdf)

The data is the DRIVE (https://drive.grand-challenge.org/) dataset. 

The goal is to implement and train these architectures in PyTorch, and compare their performance in segmenting the blood vessels in the DRIVE data.
